## Notes

This challenge was particularily difficult for me, I think I had problems implementing the google API. 

Using the Open Weather API seemed to work without issue, but the times I needed to pull from the Google Api, I kept encountering errors. As such, I completed as much of the assignment as I could until I could not draw the hotel names. I filled out as much of the code as I could.

I need to research API use to resolve this.
